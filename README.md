## Play

- Setting up the Environment: You've made progress here by creating the basic structure with the player, controls, and some objects.
- Implementing Basic Movement: You've implemented controls for movement, and the player's position updates accordingly. However the player box does not.
- Adding Physics to Movement: WIP
- Enhancing Visuals: We haven't started this yet. We could consider adding textures, materials, or other visual enhancements.
- Testing and Debugging: the Player.js see // FIXME
